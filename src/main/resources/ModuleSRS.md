Certainly! User authentication and authorization are crucial components of any application, especially one like an Instagram-like app where user data privacy and security are paramount. Here is an in-depth look at the requirements for user authentication and authorization:

### User Authentication and Authorization

1. **Sign-Up and Registration**

    - **Email and Password Registration**
        - Users should be able to sign up using an email address and a secure password.
        - The system should validate the email format and ensure the password meets security criteria (e.g., minimum length, complexity).

    - **Phone Number Registration**
        - Users can register using their phone number.
        - The system should send a verification code via SMS to confirm the phone number.

    - **Third-Party Authentication**
        - Integration with third-party authentication providers (e.g., Facebook, Google, Apple).
        - Users can sign up or log in using their existing third-party account credentials.

    - **Username Creation**
        - Users choose a unique username during registration.
        - The system should check the availability of the username in real-time.

    - **Profile Setup**
        - Initial profile setup during registration (e.g., profile picture, bio).
        - Optional step that can be skipped and completed later.

2. **Login**

    - **Email/Phone and Password Login**
        - Users can log in using their registered email/phone number and password.
        - The system should provide feedback for incorrect login attempts (e.g., "Incorrect email or password").

    - **Third-Party Login**
        - Users can log in using their third-party authentication providers (e.g., Facebook, Google).

    - **Session Management**
        - Maintain user sessions with cookies or tokens (e.g., JWT).
        - Automatic session expiration after a certain period of inactivity for security.

3. **Password Management**

    - **Forgot Password**
        - Users can request a password reset link sent to their registered email.
        - The link should expire after a certain period for security.

    - **Reset Password**
        - Users can reset their password using the link sent to their email.
        - The new password should meet security criteria.

    - **Change Password**
        - Logged-in users can change their password from their profile settings.
        - The system should require the current password for verification.

4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

    - **SMS-Based Verification**
        - Send a one-time verification code to the user's registered phone number.
        - Users enter the code to complete the login process.

    - **Authenticator App**
        - Support for authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
        - Users scan a QR code during setup and use the generated codes for login.

5. **Authorization**

    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
        - Different roles with varying permissions (e.g., regular user, admin).
        - Users with admin roles can manage content, users, and app settings.

    - **Resource-Based Permissions**
        - Users can control who can view, comment, or interact with their content (e.g., public, followers, specific users).

    - **Privacy Settings**
        - Users can set their account to private, allowing only approved followers to view their posts.
        - Users can block or restrict other users.

6. **Account Recovery**

    - **Account Recovery Options**
        - Multiple options for account recovery (e.g., email, phone number).
        - Verification steps to ensure the authenticity of the account owner.

    - **Security Questions**
        - Optional security questions for additional account recovery options.
        - Users select and answer security questions during registration or profile setup.

7. **Activity Monitoring and Alerts**

    - **Login Activity**
        - Users can view recent login activity (e.g., date, time, location, device).
        - Alerts for suspicious login attempts (e.g., login from a new device or location).

    - **Account Alerts**
        - Notify users of important account activities (e.g., password change, profile update).
        - Users can set preferences for receiving alerts (e.g., email, SMS).

8. **Data Protection and Privacy**

    - **Encryption**
        - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, personal information) both in transit and at rest.
        - Use strong encryption algorithms and secure storage practices.

    - **Compliance**
        - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
        - Provide users with options to download or delete their data.
